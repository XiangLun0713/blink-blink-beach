# Blink Blink Beach
An Android Application to facilitate voluntary beach and ocean cleaning movement.

## Project Background
Beach and ocean pollution is a problem handmade by humans, but there is always a lack of organization, groups of people and platform to clean up these polluted oceans and beaches. This may cause more serious problems such as destroying the ecosystem of the beach and affecting the city's appearance. These kinds of problems also reflect our country's lack of environmental awareness. So, our project is a voluntary ocean and beach cleaning movement system that aims to unify all ocean and beach cleaning events in a dedicated platform. Our application will include a report system to let users report the happening issues in polluted ocean and beaches. After a user has reported a polluted beach, an organizer will initiate a beach cleaning event which gathers the residents around the beach to clean the beach. Besides, the initiated beach cleaning events can kick-start a donations feature if it requires monetary support. Furthermore, our application also provides statistical information for users to be more aware about the pollution issues as well as using the information to boost tourism.

## Objectives
- To provide a platform for voicing up and reporting beach and ocean pollution issues.
- To make the process of organizing and managing ocean and beach-cleaning events easier.
- To make it easier to find and participate in the ocean and beach-cleaning events.
- To use a reward system to encourage volunteers to participate in the ocean and beach-cleaning activities.
- To create a platform for organizations to become aware of the existence of the events, and to sponsor them.
- To protect the natural environment for future generations.
- To raise awareness by providing the statistics of the reported case on beach and ocean pollution issues.
- Implement machine learning techniques to identify genuine reports by filtering out those with fake photos.
