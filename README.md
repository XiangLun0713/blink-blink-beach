## Introduction
Beach and ocean pollution is a problem handmade by humans, but there is always a lack of organization, groups of people and platform to clean up these polluted oceans and beaches. This may cause more serious problems such as destroying the ecosystem of the beach and affecting the city's appearance. These kinds of problems also reflect our country's lack of environmental awareness. That's why we created Blink Blink Beach, a voluntary ocean and beach cleaning movement application that aims to unify all ocean and beach cleaning events in a dedicated platform.

## Objectives
1. **To be an epicenter for beach and ocean clean up activities** that allows users who would like to carry out voluntary services to find these activities easily. Our application will provide a catalog for users to find various beach and ocean clean up activities, and with filtering, sorting and searching options, you can easily find an event that suits your needs or near your location.

2. **To provide a platform to help identify which areas of the beach and ocean are polluted.** Our application will include a report system to let users report the happening issues in polluted beaches and ocean. After a user has reported a polluted beach, an organizer can initiate a beach cleaning event which allows users to sign up for the beach cleaning activities.

3. **To provide a convenient way for event organizers to organize beach cleanup activities.** Our application aims to provide a platform for the beach organizers to easily organize their event. All of the beach cleanup activities can be created easily via the admin app based on available polluted beach reports submitted by the volunteers to determine the seriousness of the pollution and organize cleanup events.
